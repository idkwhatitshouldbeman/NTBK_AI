# Hardware Design

## Mechanical Design

### Chassis Design
The robot chassis is constructed from aluminum alloy 6061-T6 for optimal strength-to-weight ratio. The main frame measures 60cm x 40cm x 25cm and provides mounting points for all subsystems.

**Key Design Considerations:**
- Weight distribution for stability
- Accessibility for maintenance
- Modular design for easy upgrades
- Vibration damping for sensor accuracy

### Drive System
- **Motors**: 2x 200W brushless DC motors with encoders
- **Gear Ratio**: 20:1 planetary gearbox
- **Wheels**: 20cm diameter rubber wheels with tread pattern
- **Steering**: Differential drive with independent motor control

### Manipulator Design
The 6-DOF robotic arm is mounted on the front of the chassis:

**Specifications:**
- **Reach**: 60cm maximum extension
- **Payload**: 2kg at full extension
- **Repeatability**: ±1mm
- **Speed**: 0.5 m/s maximum end-effector velocity

**Joint Configuration:**
1. Base rotation: ±180°
2. Shoulder: -90° to +90°
3. Elbow: -135° to +135°
4. Wrist roll: ±180°
5. Wrist pitch: ±90°
6. Wrist yaw: ±180°

## Electrical Design

### Power Distribution
- **Main Battery**: 48V, 20Ah Li-ion pack
- **Voltage Regulation**: 12V, 5V, 3.3V rails
- **Power Management**: Smart charging with overcurrent protection

### Sensor Integration
- **LiDAR**: 360° scanning, 10Hz update rate
- **IMU**: 9-axis sensor with Kalman filtering
- **Cameras**: 2x RGB cameras, 1x depth camera
- **Ultrasonic**: 8x sensors for close-range obstacle detection

## Thermal Management
- **CPU Cooling**: Active cooling with temperature monitoring
- **Motor Cooling**: Passive cooling with heat sinks
- **Battery Management**: Thermal monitoring and protection
