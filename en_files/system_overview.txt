- **Sensors**: LiDAR, IMU, camera array, ultrasonic sensors
- **Manipulator**: 6-DOF robotic arm with gripper
- **Computing Unit**: Onboard computer running ROS2
- **Power System**: Lithium-ion battery pack with 8-hour runtime

### Software Architecture
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Middleware**: ROS2 Humble
- **Navigation Stack**: Nav2 with SLAM
- **Control System**: Custom PID controllers
- **Vision System**: OpenCV with YOLO object detection

## Key Features
- Autonomous navigation in indoor environments
- Object detection and manipulation
- Real-time mapping and localization
- Collision avoidance
- Remote monitoring and control

## Performance Specifications
- **Maximum Speed**: 1.5 m/s
- **Payload Capacity**: 10 kg
- **Operating Range**: 50m radius from base station
- **Accuracy**: ±2cm positioning, ±5° orientation
