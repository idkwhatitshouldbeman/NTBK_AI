âœ… **PROBLEM FIXED!** 
The syntax error in en_writer.py line 374 has been resolved.
- Fixed f-string with backslashes that was causing SyntaxError
- Application now imports and runs successfully
- Ready to start the server again

ðŸš€ **AI SERVICE INTEGRATION COMPLETED!**
The Notebooker application has been successfully transformed into a frontend/coordination service:
- âœ… AI tasks now delegated to external AI Automation Service
- âœ… Robust fallback system for when AI service is unavailable
- âœ… Complete task lifecycle management and monitoring
- âœ… All local functionality (database, auth, file management) preserved
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling and logging
- âœ… Full application tested and working correctly

The application is now ready for production use with AI service integration!
