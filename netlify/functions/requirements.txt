# Minimal requirements for Netlify Functions
# Only include what's actually needed for the serverless function

# No heavy dependencies like torch, transformers, etc.
# Netlify Functions have size and time limits

# Basic Python standard library is sufficient for our mock implementation
# The function only uses: json, os, datetime (all built-in)
